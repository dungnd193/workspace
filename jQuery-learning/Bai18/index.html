          jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
          The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on
          your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many
          lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods
          that you can call with a single line of code. jQuery also simplifies a
          lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM
          manipulation.
