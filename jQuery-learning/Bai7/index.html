            jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. 
            The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on 
            your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many 
            lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that 
            you can call with a single line of code. jQuery also simplifies a lot of 
            the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
